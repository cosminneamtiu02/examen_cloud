## Debugging
ðŸŒµ Create a folder called ```debugging```. Add all the screenshots created in the steps below.

- create a namespace called ```awesome``` and another called ```tools```, ex:
```shell
kubectl create namespace awesome
```
- run: ```helm upgrade --install exam .```
- checkout the ```awesome``` namespace

1. ðŸŒµ Count the pods in the exam environment (label ```env=exam```) â†’ screenshot of the used command
2. ðŸŒµ Count the pods in both the exam environment and of type frontend (label ```env=exam``` and ```tier=frontend```) â†’
   screenshot of the used command

- checkout the ```default``` namespace

3. ðŸŒµ What is the current color of the web application, in the default namespace? (screenshot from the browser)

- Run the script named ```curl-test.sh``` to send multiple requests to test the web application. Take a note of the
  output. Use this script to test the solutions of the exercises below and take screenshots of the results.

4. ðŸŒµ What container image is used to deploy the applications?
5. ðŸŒµ Inspect the deployment and identify the current deployment strategy

- If you were to upgrade the pods now, what would happen?

  a.) All pods are taken down before upgrading any

  b.) pods are upgraded few at a time

6. ðŸŒµ Let us try that. Upgrade the application by setting the image on the deployment to ```kodekloud/webapp-color:v2```.
   Run the script ```curl-test.sh``` again. Notice the requests now hit both the old and newer versions. However, none
   of them fail.

7. ðŸŒµ Change the deployment strategy to ```Recreate```. Delete and re-create the deployment if necessary. Only update the
   strategy type for the existing deployment. Upgrade the application by setting the image on the deployment
   to ```kodekloud/webapp-color:v3```. Run the script ```curl-test.sh``` again. Notice the failures. Wait for the new
   application to be ready. Notice that the requests now do not hit both the versions

## Kubernetes

ðŸŒµ Create a folder called ```kubernetes```. Add all the YAML files created in the steps below.

- Create a Pod YAML file with two containers that use the image ```alpine:3.12.0```. Provide a command for both
  containers
  that keep them running forever.
- Define a Volume of type emptyDir for the Pod. ```Container 1``` should mount the Volume to path ```/etc/a```
  and ```container 2``` should mount the Volume to path ```/etc/b```
- Open an interactive shell for container 1 and create the directory ```data``` in the mounth path. Navigate to the
  directory and create the file ```hello.txt``` with the content "Hello World". Exit the container.
- Open an interactive shell for container 2 and navigate to the directory ```/etc/b/data```. Inspect the contents of
  file ```hello.txt```. ðŸŒµ Take a screenshot, add it to the ```kubernetes``` folder. Exit out the container.
